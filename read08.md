 - you can evaluate by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be the result will be aboolean true or false
 #### we can comparing one value in the script to what you expect like this :
      - the result will be aboolean : true or false.
      
      - is equal to `==` compare two value if they are same.
      
      - is not equal to `!=` compare two value if they are not same.
      
      - strict equal to `===` to check that both the data type and value are the same.
      
      - strict not equal to `!==` to check that both the data type and value are note the same.
      
 ***logical operator to compare the results of more than one comparison operator**
          - && and
          - `||` or
          - ! not
